## Project Overview
### Scope of Work

The objective of this project was to create an interactive dashboard tailored for sales managers, facilitating the tracking of their team's quarterly performance outside of their CRM system.

### Approach

During initial review of the dataset, a preliminary plan and rough sketch were developed, laying out the framework for the project

Upon closer examination of the data, it became evident that it was organized by regions, with each region having managers overseeing 5-6 sales agents. Thus, the overarching concept was to present a range of sales metrics, allowing for comparisons at the global, regional, and individual/team levels. This approach aimed to provide managers with a comprehensive understanding of their team's performance and facilitate benchmarking against various levels

To achieve this, the dashboard was designed to display a matrix structure, showcasing the desired metrics and allowing managers to select themselves and specific quarters to view performance results, including quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) comparisons

Furthermore, recognizing the importance of understanding product sales performance, additional features were incorporated to enable managers to identify trends within both product sales, sector, country and agent performance

### Data Handling and Modeling

Data cleaning was minimal, and the modeling process was straightforward. The primary focus was on establishing a connection between the Date and sales tables to synchronize engage and close dates, with the engage date serving as the primary reference point for metric calculations
