# Image Object Detection using model `DETR-ResNet-50`

## Overview
What It Does: The DETR ResNet-50 is a deep learning model for object detection using the DETR architecture with a ResNet-50 backbone

It's effective for detecting objects in images, offering high accuracy and efficiency

## Description
his project demonstrates object detection in images using DETR (DEtection TRansformer) with ResNet-50 backbone, and presents a user-friendly interface with Gradio
